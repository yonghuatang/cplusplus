-- Iterators --
vector::begin() returns an iterator to point at the first element of a C++ vector.
vector::end() returns an iterator to point at past-the-end element of a C++ vector.
vector::cbegin() is similar to vector::begin(), but without the ability to modify the content.
vector::cend() issimilar to vector::end() but canâ€™t modify the content.
*/

/*
-- Modifiers --
vector::push_back() pushes elements from the back.
vector::insert() inserts new elements to a specified location.
vector::pop_back() removes elements from the back.
vector::erase() removes a range of elements from a specified location.
vector::clear() removes all elements.
